# Get API key

To get started with the Eagle Eye Video API you will need an API Key. This is used to identify you and your application. It also makes everything secure. To get an API Key you will need an account (so that you have some place to do some testing). You can either use your existing account or create a Developer Account. You can create an API Key in your existing account under the Account Settings.

You will have to verify your email address to create your Developer Account. You will also get an email with a shortcut to create the API Key. Click on the shortcut link to create your API Key and get started writing some code.

You may also want to purchase a development hardware kit from us (so you can connect some cameras). These are available at a large discount for developers. You can get an Eagle Eye Bridge and even some cameras from us for development and testing. Just email us for more info and pricing.

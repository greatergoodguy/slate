# Annotation

<!--===================================================================-->
## Overview

The annotation service allows you to push data into the event stream to add additional information about a camera/video.

Annotations are associated with a device and a timestamp. They are subject to normal retention logic, such that they will be discarded when the annotated time has passed beyond the retention interval.

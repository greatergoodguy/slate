# Annotation

<!--===================================================================-->
## Overview

The annotation service allows you to push data into the event stream to add additional information about a camera/video.

Annotations are associated with a device and a timestamp. They are subject to normal retention logic, such that they will be discarded when the annotated time has passed beyond the retention interval.

<!--===================================================================-->
## Create Annotation

> Request

```shell
```

> Json Response

```json
```

Create an annotation for a device at a particular timestamp, with data describing the annotation.

### HTTP Request

`PUT https://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/g/annotation`

Parameter       | Data Type   	| Description  
---------       | ----------- 	| -----------  
**device_id**   | string      	| ID of the device the annotation should be associated with
**timestamp**   | string      	| Timestamp associated with the annotation, in EEN format.
**data**   		| json   		| JSON Object representing the data associated with the annotation. No predefined data fields required.

<!--===================================================================-->
## Update Annotation

> Request

```shell
```

> Json Response

```json
```

Update an annotation for a device at a particular timestamp. Simple modifications ('atype'='mod') can be made and require you to pass the original 'timestamp' from when the annotation was created. Zero to N 'heartbeats' ('atype'='hb') can also be applied to describe changes over time for the annotation. The annotation can be ended ('atype'='end') which closes the annotation and lets you attach additional information. Each annotation event is assumed to last for 10 seconds in the absence of a heartbeat extending it. After a heartbeat, it is assumed to last for another 10 seconds. Annotations can be truncated by specifying an end event ('atype'='end').

### HTTP Request

`POST https://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/g/annotation`

Parameter       | Data Type   	| Description  | Is Required
---------       | ----------- 	| -----------  | -----------
**id**   		| string      	| ID of the annotation being updated, which is returned by PUT /annotation | true
**device_id**   | string      	| ID of the device the associated with the annotation being updated | true
**timestamp**   | string      	| If atype='mod', then this must be the timestamp associated with the annotation when originally created. If atype is 'hb' or 'end', this timestamp can be a different timestamp than the original. | true
**data**   		| json   		| JSON Object representing the data to update the annotation with. No predefined data fields required. | true
atype  			| string, enum  | The type of annotation update to make. Defaults to 'mod'. 'mod' is a simple modification of the annotation. 'hb' indicates a heartbeat event, adding information on parameters that have changed and extending duration. 'end' indicates the end of the event, and no 'hb' with a later timestamp will be accepted. <br><br>enum: end, hb, mod |

# Introduction

The Eagle Eye Video API is a comprehensive REST based API for recording, indexing, and storing camera video.  The Eagle Eye Video API handles all the heavy lifting of interfacing to the cameras, recording the video, securely transmitting it to the cloud, storing it, and then making it available to use in your applications. All of the Eagle Eye Security Camera VMS user interfaces (web, iOS, Android) have been built using this API.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

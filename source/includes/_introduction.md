# Introduction

The Eagle Eye Video API is a comprehensive REST based API for recording, indexing, and storing camera video.  The Eagle Eye Video API handles all the heavy lifting of interfacing to the cameras, recording the video, securely transmitting it to the cloud, storing it, and then making it available to use in your applications. All of the Eagle Eye Security Camera VMS user interfaces (web, iOS, Android) have been built using this API.

We have language bindings in Shell, Java, and Objective C! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

## Getting Started

The Eagle Eye Video API allows you to securely record, manage, and playback video from any camera, any place, any time.  A robust annotation interface and smart bandwidth management helps you turn terabytes of raw video into useful data.

Since the API is based on REST principles, itâ€™s very easy to write and test applications. You can use your browser to access URLs, and you can use many different HTTP clients in nearly any programming language. Give it a try.

## Get an API Key

To get started with the Eagle Eye Video API you will need an API Key. This is used to identify you and your application. It also makes everything secure. To get an API Key you will need an account (so that you have some place to do some testing). You can either use your existing account or create a Developer Account. You can create an API Key in your existing account under the Account Settings.

You will have to verify your email address to create your Developer Account. You will also get an email with a shortcut to create the API Key. Click on the shortcut link to create your API Key and get started writing some code.

You may also want to purchase a development hardware kit from us (so you can connect some cameras). These are available at a large discount for developers. You can get an Eagle Eye Bridge and even some cameras from us for development and testing. Just email us for more info and pricing.
